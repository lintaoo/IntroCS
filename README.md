In 2017 summer, I was the instructor of “Introduction to Computer Science” for Penn State Upward Bound Programs.

Rather than trivial technical details, I try to teach the “big picture” in computer science.

For example, I present the history of Programmer and the core of computer science.

There are some basic problems, discussion questions and homework during the course.
